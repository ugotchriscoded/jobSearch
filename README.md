### Step 1: Preparing project

Open the folder where you have **all your projects** in **Visual Studio** and
Enter the command in the **Git Bash** terminal:

```php
 $ composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel jobSearch
 ```

> [!NOTE] 
> this command is used to install **Laravel** and **Composer**.

### Step 2: Files and repository

You must create a folder that will contain the **Laravel files** created **automatically**.

> [!WARNING] 
> Once created, you must open it **individually** from the folder where it is hosted on your device. Otherwise, you can that doesn't work properly.

You will have to **link it** to your **repository**.

> [!NOTE] 
> If everything has gone well you should see the **Laravel** readme when opening
your repository.

### Step 3: Put everything up to date

Switch branch to **dev** with the command:

```php

> [!CAUTION] 
> Don't forget to use *git pull* to bring your repository branches.

Then enter the command:

```php
npm install
```

> [!CAUTION] 
> It may not work if you do not have **node.js** installed.

### Step 4: Create database
Creating a database in **Admin** **SQL**.

### Step 6: Key

To generate an **application key** enter the command:

### Step 7: Create tables 
Enter this command so Laravel includes **viewable example tables** in the browser:

```php
php artisan migrate:fresh

> These tables must appear within.

To create a new table enter the commands:

```php
php artisan make:migration create_jobsearch_table
```

> Other table must be created in the migrations folder. To update the info use:

```php
php artisan migrate:fresh
```
