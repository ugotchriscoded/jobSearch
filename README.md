### Step 1: Preparing project

Open the folder where you have **all your projects** in **Visual Studio** and
Enter the command in the **Git Bash** terminal:

```php
 $ composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel jobSearch
 ```

> [!NOTE] 
> this command is used to install **Laravel** and **Composer**.

### Step 2: Files and repository

You must create a folder that will contain the **Laravel files** created **automatically**.

> [!WARNING] 
> Once created, you must open it **individually** from the folder where it is hosted on your device. Otherwise, you can that doesn't work properly.

You will have to **link it** to your **repository**.

> [!NOTE] 
> If everything has gone well you should see the **Laravel** readme when opening
your repository.
